Simple run, set some time and close to tray, or minimize to taskbar. Before

timeout is restored for 5s every minute.

Buttons for stop reset timer, pause/play pause timer and numbered buttons
adding minutes to current timeout. If time is negative adding to 0m.

The buttons "Work" and "Pause" you can configure to your preferred time, and
can specify scripts which run on start work and pause interval.
